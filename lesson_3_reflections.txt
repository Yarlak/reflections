When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If you are working with other people on a project then you will need to have a central location to store all of the most up to date code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	I think that it is important to control when your local files are updated from GiHub. If you are in the middle of an unsaved change and GitHub pushes the most recent commits to your computer you might loose all the progress you have made.
